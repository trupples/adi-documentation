Power Input
===========

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG is powered from a single 12V supply. Requirements for the
supply are 12V +/-8%, 120W.

Hot Swap Controller
-------------------

ADRV9009-ZU11EG features a hot-swap controller :adi:`ADM1177` that allows safe board insertion from a live back-plane. ADM1177 also comes with digital current and voltage monitoring via on-chip 12-bit analog-to-digital converter communicating through I2C interface with the processor. ADM1177 is available in Linux as a hardware monitor device and could be accessed using python to measure SOM's current consumption.

Power Monitoring
================

The :adi:`ADM1266` voltage sequencer/supervisor is used to handle following tasks:

-  Monitors 12V voltage input. If it exits the +/-4% (11.5V...12.5V) window PWR_FAULT2 signal will be asserted, if it exceeds +/-8% (11V...13V) the power to the RF-SOM will be switched off.
-  Controls the power-up voltage sequence of the internal supplies. Asserts PG_SOM and monitors the incoming PG_ALL signal.
-  Supervises internal voltage supplies during operation. If any of the internal supplies exceeds under/over voltage limits power to the RF-SOM will be turned off
-  Supervises on-board temperature. If the on-board temperature exceeds 65degC PWR_FAULT1 signal will be asserted, if it passes 90degC power to the RF-SOM will be switched off.
-  Turns power off in any of the previous mentioned cases, deasserts PG_SOM and
   records the event in a non-volatile Blackbox.

Power Fault Signals
-------------------

The two fault signals PWR_FAULT1 and PWR_FAULT2 are open-drain active high signals with internal 4.7K pull-ups to 1.8V. These are controlled by the :adi:`ADM1266` as previously mentioned. The purpose of the fault signals is to prompt that either temperature or input voltage are close to the limit, and a power down is imminent. Once power is turned off the state of the fault signals will reset, and the cause of the shutdown can be found only by accessing the :adi:`ADM1266` Blackbox.

Power Good Signals
------------------

The RF-SOM uses the two power good signals, PG_SOM and PG_ALL, to ensure a
correct power-up timing for the internal circuitry. While PG_SOM is an output
controlled by the on-board ADM1266, PG_ALL is an input and must be asserted by
the carrier. Both signals are active high open drain signals, with on-board
pull-ups to 1.8V. The diagram below shows the power good sequence at start-up:

|image3|

Reading the ADM1266 Blackbox Memory
-----------------------------------

Following tools are needed to read the Blackbox records:

-  :adi:`ADI Power Studio <en/design-center/adi-power-studio>` GUI Software
-  :adi:`EVAL-ADP-I2C-USB <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-ADP-I2C-USB>` I2C USB dongle.

The I2C dongle connects to the :adi:`ADM1266` dedicated I2C interface signals SCL_ADM1266_3V3, SDA_ADM1266_3V3 accessible in connector P2.

The image below shows how to connect the I2C USB dongle to P19 on the :adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC` carrier board.

|image4|

After connecting the I2C cable open the ADI Power Studio software, connect to
the dongle and open the ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM project located below. The
Blackbox Records can be accessed from the Monitor menu.

Interfaces
==========

RGMII Ethernet
--------------

The RF-SOM has an on-board Marvell 88E1512 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet PHY
connected to the GEM3 Controller in the PS on the Xilinx ZU11EG. The MDI signals
are available in the interface connector P2.

USB
---

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG features both USB 2.0 and USB 3.0, configured in host,
device or OTG mode. For USB 2.0 there is an on-board USB3320 ULPI transceiver
connected to USB0 controller on the ZU11EG Zynq Ultrascale+. For USB3.0 the I/O
path runs through the PS-GTR transceivers.

Gigabit Serial Interfaces
-------------------------

-  PS-GTR transceivers support data rates up to 6Gb/s and provide I/O path for USB3.0, SGMII Ethernet, DisplayPort.
-  GTH transceivers run up to 12.5Gb/s and being highly configurable, support a
   wide range of application like additional JESD lanes for synchronizing
   multiple ADRV9009 transceivers, 100Gb Ethernet, PCIe

Low Speed Interfaces
--------------------

The PS Multiplexed IOs (MIO) give access to the low speed interfaces inside the
Zynq Ultrascale+. The IO voltage level on all MIO pins is 1.8V. For other
voltages external voltage level are required.

-  2x I2C buses. I2C0 is connected as well to the internal I2C bus and has 2.2K pull-ups to 1.8V.
-  1x SPI bus
-  2x UART buses. UART1 is used for debug messages and should be always
   connected.

Programmable Logic GPIOs
------------------------

High Performance GPIOs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programmable logic high performance banks 65, 67 and 68 are fully accessible in
connector P2. Prior of using these signals the bank supply VCCO must be
provided, with a voltage between 0.95V and 1.9V. A reference voltage must be
applied as well, if the IO standard requires one. To use the internal VREF
voltage a 500 or 1KOhm resistor needs to be connected from VREF pin to ground.

High Density GPIOs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Programmable logic High density bank 89 is partially available in connector P2.
Connect a voltage between 1.14V and 3.4V to the bank supply voltage VCCO_89.

ADC inputs
~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, some of the IOs in bank 89 AD12P/N to AD15P/N can be used as ADC
inputs for the ZU11EG on-chip System Monitor. The internal 1.25V reference is
used. The analog input range for unipolar operation is 0... 1V. For bipolar
operation the differential voltage is between -0.5V ... 0.5V, with the
common-mode voltage 0.5V.

SD card
-------

The ZU11EG on-chip SD Controller is compatible with SD memory card specification
version 3.01, supporting UHS-I speeds and SDXC capacity format. The RF-SOM
includes an on-board uSD card connector, but provides the possibility to place
an SD card connector on the carrier. An on-board multiplexer is able to switch
between the two connectors. SD IOs and SDIO_SEL signal are available in
connector P2. Leave SDIO_SEL floating for uSD on RF-SOM. Pull SDIO_SEL to ground
for using the SD on the carrier.

--------------

Minimal Carrier Setup
=====================

This chapter shows the connections to the ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM, that are
mandatory for a minimum functional RF-SOM and carrier system.

Power Input and Power Good signals
----------------------------------

Connect 12V, 120W voltage supply. Connect PG_ALL to PG_SOM.

Xilinx Zynq Ultrascale+ ZU11EG Configuration
--------------------------------------------

Reset Pins, Status LEDs, Mode Pins, JTAG connector
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The carrier needs to include reset buttons, LEDs for status signals, slide
switches for selecting the configuration mode and JTAG connector as shown here:

|image5|

SD Card
-------

If the mechanical setup requires, place an SD card on the carrier and pull
SDIO_SEL to ground.

UART Interface for Debug
------------------------

Connect UART1 interface in the carrier (MIO pins 16 and 17). The IO voltage
level on these pins is 1.8V, so if a USB to UART interface like the FTDI FT232R
is used, a voltage level translator from 3.3V to 1.8V must be used.

RGMII Ethernet
--------------

For a minimal setup it is recommended to use the RGMII Ethernet, since it
requires only the RJ45 connector with magnetics on the carrier.

Clock and Synchronization Signal Inputs
---------------------------------------

Place BNC connector to provide access to input clock signals
CLKIN0_HMC7044B_P/N, CLKIN1_HMC7044B_P/N and synchronization SYNC_HMC7044B.
These signals are required for synchronizing multiple ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOMs.

ADM1266 Power Sequencer I2C Interface
-------------------------------------

In order to be able to access the Blackbox memory the ADM1266 I2C interface needs to be accessible. Place a 1x4pin, 2.54mm pitch, male header to mate with the :adi:`EVAL-ADP-I2C-USB <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/EVAL-ADP-I2C-USB>` dongle. Consult the Power Monitoring section for the connector pinout. The 4-th pin is VBUS and can be discarded.

Active Cooler
-------------

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM requires active cooling. The heat spreader plate is designed to accommodate an active cooler with an AMD type SP3/TR4/sTRX4 socket. For more details consult the **Mechanical Reference** section.

Synchronizing multiple ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOMs
==============================================

The following link includes detailed description on synchronization hardware and
software:

-  :doc:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG Multi-SOM Synchronization </solutions/reference-designs/adrv9009zu11eg/syncronization>`.

The synchronization of multiple :adi:`ADRV9009` is accomplished by phase aligning the SYSREF and REFCLK fed into the transceiver and the deterministic latency of the JESD204B data path interface. The phase aligning mechanism is built around the :adi:`HMC7044B`, a high-performance jitter attenuator, capable of generating 14 ultralow phase noise output frequencies. Phase alignment is achieved by the pulsed SYNC or RFSYNC inputs, giving the possibility to extend the clock tree to multiple stages.

The complete prototyping system built out of :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG`, :adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC`, :adi:`AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ` acts as a proof of concept for synchronizing multiple :adi:`ADRV9009` transceivers. The diagram below shows the clock tree for a synchronized system consisting of eight :adi:`ADRV9009` (2 carriers). With a single HMC7044B synchronization board there is the possibility of extending the number of carriers to three, totaling twelve :adi:`ADRV9009` transceivers. For extending this number multiple HMC7044B synchronization boards need to be cascaded.

   The System Clocking Tree Diagram is located here:

   |ADRV9009-ZU11EG Clock Tree|

There are two ways of phase aligning the output clocks, by distributing directly
the clock or by distributing the reference. Either comes with advantages and
disadvantages and a decision which to use is application dependent.

Clock Distribution
------------------

The clock generated by the first stage :adi:`HMC7044B` is distributed throughout the clock tree. The :adi:`HMC7044B` in the lower stages are acting only as fanout buffers. The synchronization is accomplished by pulses on the RFSYNC input. This architecture is easier to manage and is lower power, since only the first stage PLL and VCO are active. Since the high frequency clock signal needs to be distributed it might create routing problems.

Reference Distribution
----------------------

In reference distribution the PLLs inside the :adi:`HMC7044B` stages are active and work as clock generators and jitter cleaners, being synchronized by the SYNC input. This architecture provides ultralow jitter and removes the risk of coupling of unwanted signals in the clock chain.

The clocking map below shows the path for both clock and reference distribution.
An example is shown for VCXO of 122.88MHz and internal VCO frequency of
2919.12MHz.

Thermal Considerations
======================

.. important::

   The ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM requires active cooling. It includes
   overtemperature protection, which interrupts power to the RF-SOM when board
   temperature reaches 90degC. Without a fan the RF-SOM will turn off in a few
   minutes under normal operating conditions (25degC ambient, Linux machine
   running).

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM comes equipped with a custom designed heat spreader
plate, that acts as a mounting base for an active cooler. Panasonic
EYG-T7070A10A thermal pad is used between RF-SOM and plate.

The heat spreader is designed to accommodate an active cooler with an AMD type
SP3/TR4/sTRX4 socket. There are two sets of threaded holes. When thermal sheet
is added between heat plate and fan the set of holes with the smaller thread
depth should be used for mounting the fan.

The :adi:`ADRV2CRR-FMC` kit includes a heatsink with fan for the ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM, and Würth Elektronik 39410 EMI gasket sheet, that acts both as thermal transfer material between plate and heatsink, and RF Shield/Absorber.
