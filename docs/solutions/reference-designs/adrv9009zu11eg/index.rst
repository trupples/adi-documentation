ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF System-on-Module
===================================

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`ADRV9009-ZU11EG` :adi:`Export Info <ADRV9009-ZU11EG>` is a highly integrated RF System-On-Module(RF-SOM) based on the Analog Devices :adi:`ADRV9009` and Xilinx `Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC <https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/zynq-ultrascale-mpsoc.html>`_. The RF-SOM is a platform for evaluation and prototyping. To use the RF-SOM a carrier board is required. The Analog Devices ADRV2CRR-FMC Carrier board is designed for this purpose. An additional RF Transceiver board can also be fitted to the carrier to further expand the system up to 8 Tx and Rx radio channels.

**The RF-SOM box includes:**

-  ADRV9009-ZU11EG RF-SOM
-  Heat spreader plate(fitted to the RF-SOM during manufacturing)

**The Carrier box includes:**

-  ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier board(needed to evaluate the RF-SOM), SD-Card, Fan Heatsink and other accessories to get the user up and running
-  Full details found in the Carrier section

Hardware Design Details
-----------------------

.. important::

   For Clock Distribution Synchronization some passive components need to be changed on the :doc:`ADRV2CRR-FMC </solutions/reference-designs/adrv9009zu11eg/adrv2crr-fmc_carrier_board>` Carrier Board.

Application Development
-----------------------

Multiple ADRV9009-ZU11EG’s can be synchronized together enabling a complete solution for complex multi-stream applications ensuring end-to-end deterministic latency. The ADRV9009 Transceivers include integrated LO and phase synchronization. Overall system frequency & phase synchronization is maintained with a clock tree structure using ADI high performance low jitter :adi:`HMC7044` devices, making it ideal for applications requiring RF phase alignment with a large number of channels.

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG has extensive I/O capability. Combined with the ADRV2CRR-FMC evaluation carrier board a variety of high speed I/O can be evaluated, including USB3, USB2, PCIe 3.0 x8, QSFP+, SFP+, 1Gb Ethernet x2, and CPRI capability. Please review the I/O functionality reference table provided in the :doc:`ADRV2CRR-FMC </solutions/reference-designs/adrv9009zu11eg/adrv2crr-fmc_carrier_board>` homepage for more details on the functionality provided.

An additional High Pin Count FMC Daughter Board (AD-FMCOMMS8-EBZ) can be plugged
into the carrier board with a further two ADRV9009 Transceivers increasing to a
total of Eight Tx and Rx channels. A design can easily be evaluated and then
integrated seamlessly into a custom carrier for further prototyping, or a final
product greatly accelerating time to market.

Platform development support includes examples of Linux Industrial I/O (IIO)
Applications, MATLAB®, Simulink®, GNU Radio, and streaming interfaces for custom
C, C++, python, and C# applications. HDL reference designs and drivers will be
provided to help users get up and running faster. Due to varying implementation
options for the various I/O interfaces different levels of functionality will be
provided for each one, further details will be available in the applications
section.

--------------

System setup & evaluation
-------------------------

The ADRV9009-ZU11EG can be booted from the onboard SD card slot or the SD card
slot on the ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier board. An SD card containing a bootable image
ships in the ADRV2CRR-FMC carrier kit.

Users should check that they have the appropriate Vivado license in place to be
able to use and build the reference HDL code provided for the Ultrascale+ MPSOC
in the system.

People who follow the flow that is outlined, have a much better experience with things. However, like many things, documentation is never as complete as it should be. If you have any questions, feel free to :ez:`ask <fpga>`.
