AD-FXTOF1-EBZ
=============

.. important::

   This system has reached its end of life and has a last time buy status.

Introduction
------------

The :adi:`AD-FXTOF1-EBZ <en/design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/AD-FXTOF1-EBZ.html>` is a proven hardware platform for depth perception. When paired with a processor board from the Raspberry Pi or Nvidia family, it can be used for 3D software and algorithm development. The solution has VGA resolution which means that objects can be detected to a higher level of granularity than other 3D ToF solutions, an ability to detect depth in strong ambient light conditions and multiple range detection modes for increased accuracy. A native and host SDK is provided. The SDK also provides OpenCV, Python®, MATLAB®, Open3D and RoS wrappers so that developers can use them to simplify application development.

Application Development

   :width: 300

The system has options of USB, Ethernet or Wi-Fi to connect to a host computer,
this flexibility enables evaluation across a wide range of use cases and
environments. Sampling rates of up to 30fps are supported. Data is fed from the
depth camera to the processor board over MIPI-CSI interface. This data is read
using V4L2 capture driver and in-turn either feeds it to native SDK or sends it
to the Host SDK over Ethernet, WiFi and USB interfaces. Native/Host SDK provides
this data to user applications for further use. For ease of application, the SDK
also provides OpenCV, Python and MATLAB wrappers such that developers can simply
use these wrappers to develop application.

The Depth Perception Rapid Prototyping Platform supports a wide range of
operating systems and programming languages. An open-source SDK that accompanies
the hardware platform enables you to extract depth data from the camera on the
processor and operating system of your choice. Windows and Linux support are
built into the SDK as well as sample code and wrappers for various languages
including Python, C/C++ and MATLAB. The SDK also integrates with 3rd party
technologies like OpenCV and RoS.
