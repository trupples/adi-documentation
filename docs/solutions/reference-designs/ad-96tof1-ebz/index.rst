**Laser Board**

The laser board generates the IR light pulses to illuminate the scene. It
connects directly to the AFE board and is powered and controlled through the
interface connector, with an option of external power if needed for specific use
case with different VCSEL.

-  The laser board has 4 individual lasers with appropriate precision driver and power components for accurate firing of the lasers.
-  The board is designed with the lasers positioned so that they fit around the AFE board CCD sensor when mated together. This position gives optimum performance for a wide range of use cases minimizing any effects of shadowing.
-  It receives power and all control I/O through the interface connector.

**Key parts:**

-  *VCSEL:* Finisar I940-G2332-NBC-D1-110B85R
-  *MOSFET driver:* :adi:`ADP5202`
-  *MOSFET:* EPC2007C
-  *Temperature measurement:* :adi:`ADT7410`
-  *Power:* :adi:`ADP2504`

.. note::

   The previous board versions (Rev. B and Rev. C) use MOSFET driver: :adi:`ADP3624`

**AFE Board**

The AD-96TOF1-EBZ AFE Board from factor is compliant with the 96Boards mezzanine
specification and can connect to compatible 96Board processor family or to
Raspberry Pi compatible boards via an additional MIPI connector interface on the
PCB. It has an EEPROM to store the ToF AFE firmware and system calibration data.
System temperature measurement is enabled through an embedded temperature
sensor.

-  The AFE board contains a Panasonic CCD Sensor combined with ADDI9036 TOF Signal Processor with necessary power and timing signal chains.
-  Optics are fitted to the board using industry standard mounting adapters to give a wide field of view, but can be changed based on individual use cases. There is a threaded adapter for mechanical mounting on an optional tripod stand.

**Key parts:**

-  *CCD sensor:* Panasonic MN34906BL
-  *Optics*: JCD J6920B lens with 940nm bandpass filter
-  *ToF AFE:* :adi:`ADDI9036` TOF Signal Processor
-  *EEPROM:* AT24CM01-XHM-B
-  *Temperature measurement:* :adi:`ADT7410`
-  *Power:* :adi:`ADP5071`, :adi:`LTC3119`, :adi:`ADP7112`, :adi:`ADP5023`

Application Development
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The system has options of USB, Ethernet or Wi-Fi to connect to a host computer,
this flexibility enables evaluation across a wide range of use cases and
environments. Sampling rates of up to 30fps are supported. Data is fed from the
depth camera to the processor board over MIPI-CSI interface. This data is read
using V4L2 capture driver and in-turn either feeds it to native SDK or sends it
to the Host SDK over Ethernet, WiFi and USB interfaces. Native/Host SDK provides
this data to user applications for further use. For ease of application, the SDK
also provides OpenCV, Python and MATLAB wrappers such that developers can simply
use these wrappers to develop application.

The Depth Perception Rapid Prototyping Platform supports a wide range of
operating systems and programming languages. An open-source SDK that accompanies
the hardware platform enables you to extract depth data from the camera on the
processor and operating system of your choice. Windows and Linux support are
built into the SDK as well as sample code and wrappers for various languages
including Python, C/C++ and MATLAB. The SDK also integrates with 3rd party
technologies like OpenCV and RoS.
