EVAL-CN0503-ARDZ
================

Multiple Parameter Optical Liquid Measurement Platform
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

:adi:`CN0503` is a reconfigurable multi-parameter optical liquid
measurement platform capable of performing colorimetry, turbidity, and
fluorometry. The design minimizes complexity by using a highly integrated
multimodal sensor front end capable of simultaneously driving four LEDs, and
synchronously measuring four pairs of photodiodes at a flexible sampling rate.
Furthermore, the front end has on-chip digital filters and high ambient light
rejection which allow the platform to operate regardless of environmental
lighting conditions.

LED and Photodiode Boards
-------------------------

The :adi:`CN0503` supports 4 channels or paths of light which can be
configured for different types of optical measurements. The 2 channels at the
sides are capable of measuring light intensity reflected at 90 degrees from
the liquid sample to support measurements for turbidity, fluorescence, etc.
The LED boards placed in each of the 4 channels are interchangeable and
natively support 8 different wavelengths. Additional spare boards are
available to accommodate LEDs with other wavelengths.

Assembling the Mechanical Fixtures
----------------------------------

:adi:`CN0503` uses 3D printed mechanical fixtures to enable four directed light
paths to the liquid sample held in a **Cuvette**. The mechanical fixtures can be classified
into two separate objects: the **Mounted Base** and the **Tower**. The **Mounted Base**
is capable of holding four **Towers** which are freely interchangeable, as well as two
**Fluorescent Filters**. The **Tower** holds the **Cuvette**, which contains the liquid
sample, and optical glass items: a **Condenser Lens**, a **Neutral Density Filter**, a
**Narrowband Transmit Filter**, and a **Beamsplitter**. Below are two videos showing the
assembly of the base and tower, respectively.

Assembling the Base
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mounting the Base
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A **Mounted Base**  fits on top of the **Main Board**  by following the outlined position in the
silkscreen. At its bottom, attach 4 **M1 magnets**  to the provisions as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200429_094741.jpg

.. important::

   Watch out for these magnets as they may fall off when placing the **Mounted Base**  on top of
   the **Main Board**.

The **Mounted Base** will fit snugly between the LED and PD connectors.

.. image:: img_20200428_100643.jpg

Secure the **Mounted Base** to the **Main Board**  using 10 **S2 Screws**  and 10
**Hex Nuts**  at the holes at its sides as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200428_113023.jpg

Connecting the LED and Photodiode (PD) Boards
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **LED Boards** are drawn with a huge ‘X’ on the silkscreen which marks
the center of the area of interest or the active area of the LED.
To mount the **LED Boards**, face the top of the board with the LED facing
towards the small window of the **Mounted Base** and attach the 4-pin female connectors to the
jumper headers marked LED as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200428_113432.jpg

.. important::

   Be sure to check if the ‘X’ mark is centered at the middle of the small window of the base.

To mount the photodiode (PD) boards, face the top of the board with the
photodiode facing towards the small window of the base and attach the 4-pin
female connectors to the jumper headers marked PD as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200429_103950.jpg

.. image:: img_20200429_104010.jpg

.. important::

   The two **Fluorescent PD Boards** should be placed at opposite
   sides of the base. The exact centering of the photodiode is not crucial.

.. tip::

   To replace or remove the PD and LED boards, pull the the notch in
   each board using a flat screw driver or fingernail to lift it up from the
   jumper headers.

Inserting the Flourescent Filters
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two **Fluorescent Filters**  can be placed in the square
slot in front of each **Fluorescent PD Board**  as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200429_112032.jpg
   :width: 500 px
   :align: center

Assembling the Tower
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tower holds the optical glass items and the cuvette which holds the liquid
sample. This section details how each of these items are assembled into
position to form the light path and also, the 3D printed mechanical fixtures
which hold them in place (**Cuvette Holder**, **Cuvette Holder Cover**,
**Beamsplitter Cover**, and **Lens Cover**).

.. tip::

   Following the proper order of steps to assemble the tower makes it easier to
   do as well as prioritizes the important optical glass pieces.

Securing the Beamsplitter
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Beamsplitter**  is used to direct the light path to both the liquid
sample in the **Cuvette**  as well as the reference photodiode located below
it. It is angled at 45 degrees with respect to the light path and should be
held tightly in place. Slight movements of the **Beamsplitter**  will affect
the measurement ratios obtained from the transmit photodiode and reference
photodiode.

#. Starting with the **Cuvette Holder**, insert two **Hex Nuts** to each of the
   two circular depressions as shown below. These should be completely pressed
   and held tight to the depression to avoid the hassle of them coming off
   later.

   .. image:: img_20200429_185807.jpg

#. Insert the **Beamsplitter**  in the angled 45 degree slit. Be careful in
   applying pressure as this may damage the part.

   .. image:: img_20200429_185845.jpg

#. Secure the **Beamsplitter**  with the **Beamsplitter Cover** as shown below.

   .. image:: img_20200429_185908.jpg

#. Screw the **Beamsplitter** to the **Cuvette Holder** using 2 **S1 Screws**
   at the two holes as shown below. Be sure to drive the screws in until the
   head no longer protrudes from the depression.

   .. image:: img_20200429_190014.jpg

.. tip::

   Check for slight movements of the **Beamsplitter** by listening for clicking
   sounds when you shake the **Cuvette Holder**.

Securing the Condenser Lens
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Condenser Lens** is used to focus and direct the light from the LED
through the tower and form the light path. Thus, it is important that the
**Condenser Lens** be positioned properly and tightly secured so that no slight
movements occur.

#. Attach 2 **Hex Nuts** to each of the two circular depressions on the
   **Cuvette Holder** as shown below. These should be completely pressed and
   held tight to the depression to avoid the hassle of them coming off later.

#. Place the **Condenser Lens** on the **Cuvette Holder**. This will be easier
   to do by rotating the **Cuvette Holder** vertically so that the **Condenser
   Lens** will drop in position.

.. image:: img_20200429_190145.jpg

#. Press the **Lens Cover** to the **Cuvette Holder** and screw it in place
   using an **S2 Screw** at the bottom hole (marked green) and an **S1 Screw**
   at the top hole (marked red) as shown below.

.. image:: img_20200429_190252.jpg

.. tip::

   Check for slight movements of the lens by listening for clicking sounds when
   you shake the **Cuvette Holder**.

Adding a Narrowband Transmit Filter and Neutral Density Filter (Optional)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. note::

   This step is typically not required, because the EVAL-CN0503-ARDZ kit does
   not contain these components. Both the **Narrowband Transmit Filter** and
   **Neutral Density Filter** are optional items which can be added to the
   optical path if your application requires it.

   #. The **Narrowband Transmit Filter** is used to select specific wavelengths
      of light from a wideband LED. Place the filter into the **Cuvette
      Holder** as shown below. The placement does not need to be as secure
      and tight as the **Beamsplitter** and **Condenser Lens**.

   #. The **Neutral Density Filter** is used to decrease the light intensity
      for a wide range of wavelengths. For instances wherein the LED light
      intensity easily saturates the photodiode current input to the
      :adi:`ADPD4101`, adding the **Neutral Density Filter** will help
      decrease the input current range.

       .. image:: img_20200429_190439.jpg

Placing the Cuvette Cover
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Cuvette Cover** secures the hold for the **Cuvette** and shields the
measurement light path from external sources. It also prevents the optional
filters from being knocked out of the **Cuvette Holder**. Thus, it is necessary
to lock the **Cuvette Holder** as detailed below.

#. Insert a **Hex Nut** in the depression in the **Cuvette Cover**. This should
   be completely pressed and held tight to the depression to avoid the hassle
   of it coming off later.

    .. image:: img_20200429_190531.jpg

#. Place the **Cuvette Cover** on top of the **Cuvette Holder** as shown below.

    .. image:: img_20200429_190545.jpg

#. Secure the **Cuvette Cover** using an **S3 Screw** at the specified hole
   shown below.

Placing the Cuvette
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Cuvette** can easily be added to the **Cuvette Holder** as shown below.

.. note::

   **(Optional)** The **Cuvette Holder** is a tight fit for 10mm by 10mm **Cuvette**. When using a smaller-sized cuvette,
   a provisional screw hole can be used to press against the **Cuvette** and secure it.

#. Remove the **Cuvette Cover** and insert a **Hex Nut** in the depression in
   the **Cuvette Holder** as shown below. This should be completely pressed and
   held tight to the depression to avoid the hassle of it coming off later.

    .. image:: img_20200429_190512.jpg

#. Replace the **Cuvette Cover** and attach an **S2 Screw** at the specified
   hole in the **Cuvette Holder** as shown below. The depth of the screw can be
   adjusted to increase or decrease the tightness of the hold.

The **Mounted Base** accommodates up to a maximum of 4
**Towers**.

**Towers** are interchangeable and can be placed in any of the 4
positions. To attach the **Tower** to the **Mounted Base**,
it should hang from the top of the walls of the base. Slight
pressure may be needed to fully push the **Tower** down.

Jumper Settings
---------------

The :adi:`CN0503` has ten jumper positions which configure different
settings as shown below. The default shunt positions are highlighted.

.. image:: jumperlocations.jpg

1.8V LDO Enable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

P1.8V enables the 1.8V LDO supply which sources its input voltage from the
Arduino 3.3V pin. By default, a shunt is placed in P1.8V.

Photodiode Selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are 4 photodiode selection headers available to the two side light
paths. These 2 light paths have the option to use a fluorescent photodiode
located at right angles from the light path. The combination of which
photodiodes to be used by the :adi:`ADPD4101` can be configured by
two selection headers, one for each input channel. Each selection header
requires two shunts to configure, to connect both anode and cathode of the
photodiode.

Demo Hardware Setup
-------------------

This section details the hardware setup of :adi:`CN0503` for a
demonstration showing 4 different experiments in each optical path, utilizing
colorimetry (absorbance measurement), turbidity, and fluorescence measurement.
Below is a general block diagram of the setup.

Listed in the table below are the **LED Boards** and optional optical glass
components used in each path.

The jumper configuration of the :adi:`CN0503` for this setup is
shown below.

Optical Path 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In optical path 1, the experiment shows the detection of quinine in tonic water
using fluorescence measurements. Optionally, you can also use samples of soda
water and de-ionized water for comparison.

- :ref:`Optical Platform: Fluorescence Measurement Demo (ADICUP3029 + EVAL-CN0503-ADRZ) <fluorescence-measurement>`

Optical Path 2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In optical path 2, the experiment shows pH measurement by using colorimetry to
detect changes the solution through the bromothymol blue indicator. As pH
changes from an acidic level to a neutral and basic level, bromothymol blue
changes color from yellow to blue. A yellow colored solution will block 430nm
light while a blue colored solution will allow it to pass. The change in pH can
be done using a simple aquarium kit.

- :ref:`Optical Platform: pH Measurement Demo (ADICUP3029 + EVAL-CN0503-ADRZ) <ph-measurement>`

Optical Path 3
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In optical path 3, the experiment shows nitrate detection using colorimetry.
Using the API reagent found in nitrate test kits, a solution with a higher
concentration of nitrate turns into a darker shade of red. As a result, the
degree of absorbance of 615nm light decreases with the increasing nitrate
concentration.

- :ref:`Optical Platform: Nitrate Measurement Demo (ADICUP3029 + EVAL-CN0503-ADRZ) <nitrate-measurement>`

Optical Path 4
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In optical path 4, the experiment shows turbidity measurements of cloudy water
made by adding a a drop of milk and de-ionized water using 530nm light.
