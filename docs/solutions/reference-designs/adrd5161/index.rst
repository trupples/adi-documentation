========

BMS module with CANopen CiA 419
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Overview
------------

	This board is a complete battery managment, charging and power delivery solution compatible with 3S Li-Ion battery packs, design for robotics, power tools and
	industrial equipment. It features and intuitive GUI for fast setup and monitoring, enabling out of the box operation with minimal configuration. The MAX17320 Fuel
	Gauge provides accurate state of charge and battery health data, while MAX77958 and MAX77961 enable customizable USB-C Charging up to 3A constant current. LTC4421
	Power Path controller prioritizes USB-C source over battery output and adds protection features. The system can deliver up to 240W (20A) output from battery and 
	integrates easily into larger systems via isolated CAN and isolated I2C.
