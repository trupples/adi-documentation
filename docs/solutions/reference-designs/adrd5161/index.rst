ADRD5161
========

BMS module with CANopen CiA 419
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Introduction
------------

The ADRD5161 is a battery management/ monitoring system compatible with 3S LiPo battery packs. It communicates via CANopen CiA 419 OVER 500 kbaud CAN.
The module functions as a state machine with 4 distinct states: Normal State, Charging State, Configure State and Shutdown state.
Battery is monitored using the MAX17320 fuel gauge chip. Charging current is handled by MAX77961 charger chip, while the MAX77958 handles power delivery.
Current state and specific parameters can be observed on the on-board OLED display.
For development and debugging, data is printed to the serial console.

Required Hardware
-----------------

* ADRD5161
* 3S LiPo battery pack with an XT60 connector 
* USB PD charger, capable of 20V 3A
* Optional: MAXPICO (or compatible) debug/ programming probe

System Setup
------------

The module comes with the firmware flashed. MAX17320 and MAX77958 are configured to be compatible
with the configuration for Panasonic NCR18650B batteries, with a total capacity 6600mAh.

To set the system up:

* connect battery pack and balancing connector
* if battery is charged: press S1 button (see image below) to start module
* if battery is discharged: plug in USB-C cable connected to 20V/3A capable power supply and module starts on its own
* after start, the firmware will go to the Configure state, wait for user input for 10s.
* if no user input received, the module will go to either Normal or Charging state, depending on whether the USB-C charging cable is plugged in or not

To poweroff the module, press S2 button. Be mindful when using this feature, as this cuts the power supply to the entire system.
