   GMSL Signal Chain

Overview
--------

The `AD-GMSLCAMRPI-ADP# <design-center/evaluation-hardware-and-software/evaluation-boards-kits/AD-GMSLCAMRPI-ADP.html>`__
enables connecting GMSL serializer and deserialier Evaluation Kits (EVK) to a
wide range of cameras and processing platforms supporting industry standard
ribbon cable connectors. The adapter consists of three sections that can be
broken apart from each other, with the following functionalities:

- A **Ribbon Cable Adapter** having two pairs of 15-pin and 22-pin connectors
  routed to each other. The 15-pin connectors support 2 MIPI lanes, while the
  22-pin connectors support 4 MIPI lanes.
- A **GMSL Serializer EVK Adapter** with two 22-pin ribbon cable connectors, for
  connecting cameras to the GMSL serializers. A USB Type-A connector is
  available to supply 5V at 4A to another system.
- A **GMSL Deserializer EVK Adapter** with two 22-pin ribbon cable connectors,
  for connecting to Raspberry Pi, Nvidia or Xilinx development platforms, or
  any other processing platform supporting the 15-pin or 22-pin ribbon cable
  connectors.

GMSL EV Kit Compatibility
-------------------------

The MIPI-CSI2 signals, I2C communication, and power pins align on the EV kits
but the MFP connections can vary.

Refer to the :dokuwiki:`Serializer and Deserializer EV Kit Compatibility Guide <resources/eval/user-guides/ad-gmslcamrpi-adp/comp_guide>` to see the connections across EV kits.

Camera Connections
------------------

Connect RPi 15-pin cameras to GMSL Serializer EV Kit’s with the 15-pin to 22-pin
adapter. Or use a 15-pin to 22-Pin Adapter Cable.

SoC Connections
---------------

The same configuration is used for the SoC side where the 22-pin adapter can be
directly connect to a Jetson Orin Development kit or use the 22-15 pin adapter
to connect to an Raspberry Pi.

Example Configurations
----------------------

The adapter can be used to connect the GMSL Deserializer EV kits to a number of
processing platforms for GMSL evaluation and application development. The user
guides below provide instructions on how to get the systems up and running by
configuring the hardware and running the associated software.
