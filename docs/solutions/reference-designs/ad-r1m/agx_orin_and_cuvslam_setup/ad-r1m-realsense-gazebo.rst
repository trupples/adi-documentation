10) AD-R1M Gazebo simulation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This simulation also includes a RealSense D435i gazebo plugin which is mounted in front of the AD-R1M platform.

**Running gazebo simulation**

.. code-block:: bash

    ros2 launch ad_r1m_cuvslam robot_realsense_sim.launch.py local_models_path:=<path_to_your_models> world_name=<your_world_name.world>

This launch file ensures Gazebo can find local models in this workspace. This helps resolve errors like 
"Unable to find uri[model://some_model]" by adding the  repository's `models/` folder to GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH.

You can find plenty of worlds and models at https://github.com/leonhartyao/gazebo_models_worlds_collection. Just download the repository 
inside your workspace and load any of the available worlds.

The gazebo simulation can be run on any PC while the cuVSLAM can be run only on a NVIDIA Isaac ROS compliant setup.

On NVIDIA AGX Orin run the docker container in a new terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

     cd $ISAAC_ROS_WS/src/isaac_ros_common
    ./scripts/run_dev.sh -i ros2_humble.realsense.visualslam

Inside the Docker container launch cuVSLAM:

.. code-block:: bash

    source install/setup.sh
    ros2 launch ad_r1m_cuvslam vslam_single_realsense.launch.py

Bellow is an example of cuVSLAM running with the AD-R1M + RealSense D435i Gazebo simulation:
