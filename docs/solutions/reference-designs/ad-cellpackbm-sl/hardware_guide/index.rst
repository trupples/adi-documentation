When software updates or new versions of the software are available an email notification will be sent to the email address associated with the MyAnalog account used to download the original software package.

MCU Configuration & Setup
--------------------------

.. note::

   By default (upon purchase), the AD-CELLPACKBM-SL Kit comes with a MAX32625PICO programmer adapter that is already loaded with the appropriate firmware image. Otherwise, if you are using a new MAX32625PICO programmer (that is not part of the original kit), make sure to flash it first with the correct firmware image before using it with the AD-CELLPACKBM-SL BMS Kit. If you do not know how to load the image, follow the instructions below.

The MCU should be programmed using the following steps:

MAX326825PICO Debugger (One-time setup)

#. Download and install the BMS Browser GUI Broadmarket.
#. Open the program files folder of the BMS Browser GUI in the host PC and look for the SDP-K1 .bin file.
    ``C:\Analog Devices\BMS_Browser_GUI_Broadmarket-Rel2.0.0\USB_TO_SPI_Firmware``
#. Plug the micro USB cable to the MAX32625PICO.
#. Press the button on the MAX32625PICO and then plug the other end of the micro-USB cable into the PC. A red LED should blink, then hold steady, and a MAINTENANCE drive should appear on your PC.
#. Drag and drop the ``SDP_K1_PyBMS_USB_TO_SPI_Bytes_Debug_USB_Port.bin`` file onto the MAINTENANCE drive. The file transfer should be complete in about 30 seconds.
#. Unplug and replug the device.
#. After completing this step, a **DAPLINK** drive should appear. You can drag and drop the firmware (.bin files separate from the above) onto it to program the SDP-K1.

BMS Browser GUI Installation
-----------------------------

#. Download the BMS Browser GUI in your Host PC.
#. Double click on ``bms_browser_gui_broadmarket-relX.Y.Z.exe`` to install the GUI.
#. Accept the license terms and click `Next`` to proceed with the installation. The default installation directory will be in ``C:\Analog Devices\``.


Launching the BMS Browser GUI
------------------------------

#. Open the BMS Browser GUI either by searching for it in the `Start Menu`` or using the shortcut on the Desktop.
#. Run the application to launch the BMS Browser GUI.
#. Upon launching, a console window will appear to display background information.
#. Two new tabs will open in the default browser on the PC, with the User Guide tab as the default.
#. Switch to the alternative tab to access the BMS Browser configuration page, which should be displayed.
#. Ensure that the SDP-K1 is connected to the PC via the USB-C cable on P10. The Blue LED, D31 will illuminate when powered.
#. In the Serial Port dropdown box, select the COM port associated with SDP-K1.

Battery Cell Monitoring
-----------------------

**Setup**

.. figure:: ADBMS6830_Setup.png

     :width: 400 px

     Cell Monitoring Setup

This setup uses the SDP-K1 as the controller board, but users may also use the AD-APARD32690-SL as MCU and follow the same hardware setup instructions.

The DC2472A Battery Emulator Board was also used for cell voltage input. Alternatively, resistors can be used to simulate battery cell voltages. 100 Ω ½ W or equivalent resistors are recommended because 100 Ω (or lower values) typically will not induce measurement errors, and the ½ W (or greater rating) will keep the resistor temperatures low, preventing power dissipation damage.

Check the **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW** User Guide for procedure on connecting resistors.

#. Connect the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** dual isoSPI adapter to the EVAL-SDP-CK1Z (SDP-K1) controller board through the Arduino headers.
#. Set the P14 jumper of the SDP-K1 to the 3.3 V position.
#. Connect the SDP-K1 (P2) to the Host PC using a USB cable.
#. Connect the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** (J1) to the **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW** (J3) using the 2-wire twisted-pair patch cable from the main DuraClik connector to isoSPI A DuraClik connector.
#. Plug the screw-terminal block(s) into the cell voltage connectors of the **DC2472A** battery emulator board. Note that the last three terminals of the **DC2472A** must be left hanging.
#. Connect the **DC2472A** battery emulator board to the **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW** through the connected cell voltage connectors (J1).
#. Power the **DC2472A**** using a 5 V external source connected to J1 using a USB cable. Alternatively, power it through PC using a USB cable to be connected via J10.
#. While some laptop USB ports may suffice for powering the emulator during evaluation, it is still recommended to use an external power supply to ensure adequate power. Note that the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW is powered through the **DC2472A**.
#. Attach the **MAX32625PICO** programmer to the SDP-K1 using the 10-pin ribbon SWD cable. Observe correct polarity when connecting the SWD cable.

**Test**

#. Open the BMS Browser GUI.
#. Go to the `Interface Connection`` section and select the COM port associated with the SDP-K1.
#. Under the `Daisy Chain`` section, ensure the `Generation`` dropdown box is set to `ADBMSGEN6`.
#. From the `Products list`, select the **ADBMS6830**, then click on the right arrow to add it to the Daisy Chain. Settings can remain as default.
#. Click `Launch`.
#. Upon launching, the `Quick Measure`` tab will open. Note: this utility only supports a single BMS product in a Daisy Chain. Click `Start Quick Measure`` to begin measurements.
#. Check the `Total PEC Status`` on the 3rd row under the `Memory Map`. This indicates the status of the isoSPI link between the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** and the EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW.
#. Ensure the **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW** board is powered correctly, indicated by the Blue LED on the DC2472A being illuminated.
#. Verify the connection of the twisted cable between the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** and the **EVAL-ADBMS6830BMSW**.
#. Check the voltage readings by adjusting the potentiometer (POT1) on the **DC2472A** to modify the emulated cell voltages. Monitor the voltage channels on the `Quick Measure Utility` graph. Select which signals to display on the graph under the `Plot All Devices`` column.

    Pack Monitoring Setup

**Setup**

#. Connect the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** dual isoSPI adapter to the **EVAL-SDP-CK1Z (SDP-K1)** controller board through the Arduino headers.
#. Set the P14 jumper of the **SDP-K1** to the 3.3 V position.
#. Connect the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** (J1) to the **EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC** (isoA) using the provided isoSPI cable.
#. Choose between two options for powering the **EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC**:
    - Supply 5 V to J1 and set the current limit to 200 mA. The **EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC** consumes less than 50 mA in idle mode and ~100 mA in active mode.
    - Alternatively, power it using a micro-USB cable connected to J10.
#. Attach the **MAX32625PICO** programmer to the **SDP-K1** using the 10-pin ribbon SWD cable. Observe correct polarity when connecting the SWD cable.
#. Connect one end of the USB cable to **SDP-K1** (P2) and the other end to the host PC.

**Test**

1. Open the BMS Browser GUI.
2. Go to the `Interface Connection`` section and select the **COM port** associated with the SDP-K1.
3. Under the `Daisy Chain`` section, ensure the `Generation`` dropdown box is set to **ADBMSGEN6**.
4. From the `Products list`, select the **ADBMS2950**, then click on the right arrow to add it to the Daisy Chain. Settings can remain as default.
5. Click `Launch`.
6. Upon launching, the `Quick Measure tab`` will open. Note: it can only handle one BMS product in a Daisy Chain. Click `Start Quick Measure`` to begin measurements.
7. Check the `Total PEC Status`` on the `Memory Map`. It should reflect true, indicating a successful isoSPI link between the **EVAL-ADBMS6822** and the **EVAL-ADBMS2950-BASIC**. If false, there is an error in the signal chain.
