Tools for Low Speed Mixed Signal System Design
----------------------------------------------

.. note::

   This is a work in progress.

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The goal of this tutorial is to equip the reader with a collection of hardware
and software tools for developing low-speed mixed-signal applications.
Content Guide: This tutorial includes complete written instructions, a video
guide, and a slide deck that can be used for delivering as a hands-on workshop.


What exactly does “Low Speed” mean? In the context of this tutorial, it
means that timing is not very critical. Signals are either completely static or
moving slowly such that it doesn't matter if the instant that an ADC samples
the signal wiggles around a bit relative to the previous sampling. While clock
jitter is one source of this uncertainty, software delays (such as the time
between a timer interrupt and the assertion of a “convert” edge) will
likely be dominant. Important parameters in low-speed applications are offset,
gain error, linearity, and temperature drift. “Noise” in a low-speed
application is typically synonymous with resolution, and is typically measured
by applying a noiseless input signal and taking a histogram of the output
readings. AC performance metrics such as signal to noise ratio and total
harmonic distortion extracted from a Fourier transform of the data will not be
considered.
In contrast - sample jitter is important in a “high speed” application. If
you are measuring signal to noise ratio, the Signal to Noise ratio (SNR) can be
no greater than:

:math:`SNR <= -20 * log(2*pi*f\_{IN}*t\_{j})`

Where:
:math:`f_{IN}` is the analog input frequency in Hz
:math:`t_{j}` is the RMS jitter in seconds RMS

So that's it. In this tutorial, we will set voltages and currents, read
voltages and currents, do some basic math, but each reading will be treated
independently, no correlation to previous or future readings. We will NOT be
measuring AC Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR), Total Harmonic Distortion (THD), nor
measuring steps, wiggles, or any other situation where precise timing is
required. (Rest assured, there are lots of very interesting applications in
this category.)
Throughout the exercises we'll be writing simple Python code to capture and
analyze data, using the industry standard Industrial I/O (IIO) framework to
interact with the ADC, and the popular NumPy and Matplotlib Python libraries.
Thus this exercise also serves as a mini-tutorial on Python.

Background
~~~~~~~~~~

This tutorial builds on the concepts covered in:
:dokuwiki:`Converter Connectivity Tutorial <university/labs/software/iio_intro_toolbox>`
It also serves as a preview to this tutorial that starts to deal with
analyzing time series data:
:dokuwiki:`Precision ADC Tutorial <university/labs/software/precision_adc_toolbox>`

Slide Deck and Video
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since this tutorial is also designed to be presented as a live, hands-on
workshop, a slide deck is provided here:

.. ADMONITION:: Download

A complete video run-through is also provided, either as a companion to
following the tutorial yourself, or to practice before presenting as a
hands-on workshop: <WRAP todo> This video is accurate, but will be
re-done at some point:

including bringing up the pyadi-iio example. Follow the instructions for downloading and
installing ADI Kuiper Linux, and editing config.txt. The only difference is the
interrupt connection and device tree overlay to be added to config.txt. For
this exercise, add the following line to config.txt:

...but I'm Confused... No-OS means no Operating System, but we're using Kuiper
Linux, and that's an Operating System. What gives?

Unlike the IIO drivers used in the previous tutorial , which
**require** the Linux kernel and operating system to function, No-OS
provides a portable software stack which can run on any platform that
supports a C compiler. This could be bare metal microcontrollers,
truly running without an operating system, up through full systems
like our Kuiper Linux running on a Raspberry Pi. The No-OS repository
includes existing support for the Linux OS, Real-Time Operating
Systems Chibios, and mbed, Raspberry Pico, as well as hardware support
for Maxim/ADI, STM32, Xilinx and Altera.
But why? Well, bringing up a toolchain for a particular embedded
processor has its own set of challenges - particularly if development
will begin on a standard development platform, then be ported to a
custom board. Runnin no-OS code on Linux provides a way to get started
on the embedded code development, before actually embedding.
A full treatment of this flow is beyond the scope of this tutorial,
but will be documented in a future tutorial.
